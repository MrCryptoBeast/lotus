      Please provide debug logs of the problem, remember you can get set log level control for:
      * lotus: use `lotus log list` to get all log systems available and set level by `lotus log set-level`. An example can be found [here](https://docs.filecoin.io/get-started/lotus/configuration-and-advanced-usage/#log-level-control).
      * lotus-miner:`lotus-miner log list` to get all log systems available and set level by `lotus-miner log set-level
      If you don't provide detailed logs when you raise the issue it will almost certainly be the first request I make before furthur diagnosing the problem.
